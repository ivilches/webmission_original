Final project on CFGS Web Applications Development (2015)

Web application for p2p sharing on browser.

It uses three APIs/libraries for this purpose: 
- Socket.io on a node server for handshake's managing, 
- RTCDataChannel for sending data between browsers
- FileSystem for reading/writing the files

This project was built when I know practically nothing about SPAs, javascript frameworks and similar. My purpose now is build three versions (Angular, Vue and React) for training on this frameworks/library and on software engineering / design patterns.
